This project was completed as part of an ElevenFifty Academy Web Development Bootcamp.

It is designed as a way to guide children's decisions about what to wear in the morning.

Here's how it works:
1) Sign up for an account
2) Click the +Person icon to add a "child" to your account.
3) In addition to a name, pick out a username for you child.  This is their "login", so don't make it too complicated.  We'll come back this this in step 7.
4) Add some events to your child's day. I'm picturing things that involve being outside - in other words, things that are weather dependent.  So, for my kid, I included "go to school", "recess", and "come home".
5) Add some clothing to your child.  Picture the things in their dresser.  Then tell the app the appropriate temperate range for each item of clothing.

You can always come back and edit these things later.  Now when you login with your account, you'll see recommended outfits for each child you set up, as well as some weather information.

How it works (continued):
6) Logout of your parent account.
7) Click "child login" and login with the child username you created in step 3. Now you'll see a simplified view consisting of just the information for this child.
8) Click the PLAY button to hear the outfit recommendation read to you.

This app works by comparing the clothing information (item and temperature range) to the local weather information for the zip code you provided at signup (the high and low daily temperature as well as the temperature at each of the event times you provided in step 4).  So the more (and more precise) information you provide, the better the recommendation will be.

Enjoy!
